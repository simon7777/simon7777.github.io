# Government spying

##### Legal spying by a government is connected with many problems which I'll try to reveal in this blog.

### More work for IT people -> *more expensive*

##### With coming demands on broadening functionality of systems by government, there comes another demands for more qualified people. Every company would need to employ experts and it would make a software more _expensive_ .

### Increase complexity of systems -> *less secure*

##### With increase of complexity, there is more bugs and errors which are hard to find. This situation will make easier to attack systems and make them less _secure_ .

### Fewer confidentiality of systems -> *less money -> less development*

##### People who buy and use software want that they are not being spied. If they knew it's legal, it would probably result into decreasement of financial incomes and consequently it would result into slower _development_.

### Conclusion

##### I think it should never be legally possible by government to spy their citizens.
